Assignment5
Casey Moher-Crook

To run:
python Assignment5.py World1MDP.txt .5

Where .5 is your value for epsilon.

Notes:
This will only work on the world file I supply, because I deleted the
two empty lines at the bottom of the given one. 

No values of epsilon changed my solution. Theoretically,
one where the E is higher should produce less stringent results,
but I didn't find that in my case. I tried values of .1, .001, .5, .75, and 1.0.
