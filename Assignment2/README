A* Assignment
Casey Moher-Crook

To run:
python A*.py World-.txt Hueristic

Possible Hueristics are 1 or 2:
huersistic 1 is the manhattan method, it just calculated the horizontal
and vertical distances and multiplies them by 10

hueristic 2 is the diagonal method. It is like the manhattan method, but
it can take diagonals, each diagonal costing 14. I implemented it without
using an equation, and instead looped through the matrix until I hit an
end, and then finished off the horizontal and vertical parts.
